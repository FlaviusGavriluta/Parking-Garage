# Parking Garage

**Your job is to design a parking garage.**

There are 2 types of parking spots: small and large.
The price of small spots is $9.99,
and for large spots itâ€™s $19.99.
Each spot has to have a unique identifier.

There are 2 types of vehicles that can park in this garage, regular cars and trucks.
Each vehicle has to have a unique identifier.
Regular cars can park in large spots but only if there are no small spots left in the garage.
Trucks can only park in large spots.

When a vehicle reserves a spot, it receives a ticket with the information of when it was reserved (date & time), the ID & price of the spot, and the ID of the vehicle.
Two vehicles cannot park in the same parking spot.
One vehicle cannot park in multiple spots at the same time.
